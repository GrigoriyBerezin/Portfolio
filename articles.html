                            <p> I've been working with front-end development for some time and today I feel a great pleasure to be part of this team. But after all, what is front-end and what it has to offer?</p>
                            <p>Front-end is the area responsible for turn into code and give life to that beautiful static design — put simply, it is the dev guy who takes care of your website's/blog's/web system's interface and usability</p>
                            <p>Today we're living in the Information Age. And with a huge convergency for web apps and systems, great on-premises platforms are turning into cloud available applications.</p>
                            <p>All this change plus those new services which already are born into the web ecosystem puts the front-end developer role in evidence, leading to a huge demand for new trained developers to manage this all. A good front-end dev can make your product such an another result on Google search or make it a stand out, attractive result to your customers.</p>
                            <p>Talking from the dev perspective, beyond the projects you would be taking part on and all the networking you'll develop, the front-end universe could offer you:</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">1) Contact with fancy technologies</p>
                            <p>In the world of development, in general, you'll have contact with several and wonderful languages, tools and platforms (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) whose make your job easier and more flexible.
                                Today it's such a mistake thinking that front-end development limits itself to HTML + CSS! The technical and knowledge level for front-end devs gets higher each day — to be a successfull dev, you must master HTML, CSS and JavaScript (only jQuery isn't enough!), have a good design sense (it's a good differential if you have some experience with graphical software), have a good knowledge about projects architecture and infrastructure, design patterns (not everything in life is a singleton)… This list gets bigger every single day…</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">2) Contact with a huge community</p>    
                            <p>Today the web devs community (front + back) is very large and some fantastic people are inserted in those communities. Github, forums, Facebook + Telegram groups, there are several channels to knowledge's dissemination. It's very difficult to have a doubt or to find a problem which cannot be solved in a short amount time with such quality support.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">3) Acknowledgment and feedback</p>
                            <p>All the development segments have acknowledgement, logically. But I believe that it's such a front-end's glamour — the people really view and interact with your stuff. The users will click the button you've coded, they will like (or not) the website layout, animations and usability — and at this point the feedback is really fast!
                                Any change you make will affect the user's navigation (either visual or performance stuff) and it can improve or worsen your website's or blog's conversion rate. All the actions made on the applications' visual layer (where front-end devs spent 90% of their time) will generate chain reactions that can be seen in short time slots.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">4) Job Vacancies</p>   
                            <p>Today it's really hard to a front-end dev find yourself without a job. There's a "we're hiring" ad at every corner — either JR, PL or SR — not mentioning the freelancer opportunities. Technology companies are investing really hard and valuing each day more this area, because if the product/service being offered is really good rated and it has a simple interface with easy assimilation to use, your visitor will become a customer in a very short time range; and that's good for everyone involved.</p>

                            <p class="text-article__bold">What should a frontend developer know and be able to do to be in demand?</p>
                            <p>The demanded frontend today is not just a person who can write clean code on a modern framework, but, first of all, a member of the product team, delving into the processes, well acquainted with the product and the goals of the company. And he is ready to leave his comfort zone and grow professionally.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">What are the most in-demand jobs right now?</p>
                            <p>In connection with the global crisis, universal developers are now more in demand, whose scope of competence does not end with the creation of the frontend. Many projects are looking not just for frontend developers whose skills are limited to writing SPA (from the English. Single Page Application - a single-page application that does not need to refresh the page, because all data is loaded using scripts), but people with a wider outlook.</p>
                            <p>Here's what a frontend developer should be able to do in 2022:</p>
                            <ul class="text-articles__ul">
                                <li class="text-articles__li">configure the environment - independently prepare the computer for work, install all the necessary programs to run the working application locally;</li>
                                <li class="text-articles__li">deploy the project — place the executable code on the server where it will work. This is the last development step;</li>
                                <li class="text-articles__li">configure CI / CD - the process of non-stop assembly and delivery of code to various environments;</li>
                                <li class="text-articles__li">take on the basic tasks of a backend developer.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>That is, the tasks are gradually becoming similar to what fullstack engineers do. And in the title of a vacancy with a front stack, you can increasingly find simply Software Engineer.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">What skills do you need to make good money?</p>
                            <p>It is one thing to be in demand in the labor market when you are just looking for a job. And another thing - the demand is already on a specific project. In the first case, you are mainly judged on hard skills. For developers of all levels, the main must-have remains the same: good knowledge of JS (JavaScript) and the popular JS framework. React remains the most popular today. It would be nice to know TypeScript (a programming language that extends the capabilities of JavaScript), have experience with design systems, CSS frameworks.</p>
                            <p>The stack varies a lot from project to project. It is far from necessary to know all the technologies that are used on the project. Demonstrate a willingness and desire to quickly learn and understand them. If the project requires, for example, SSR (Server Side Rendering is a technology for rendering pages on the server side) or GraphQL (a query language for APIs that displays data provided by the server so that the client chooses what is needed), and you never have not encountered them, you can at least watch a video about their use and play with them in the sandbox (a specially dedicated isolated environment for the safe execution of computer code).</p>
                            <p>Good projects often include a technical interview / online assessment / life coding in the candidate selection stage, where knowledge of algorithms and data structures is useful. Although the frontend rarely encounters something like this in real tasks, they often want to see such skills at the selection. It is worth practicing and solving at least 10-20 such puzzles on codewars.com and similar sites. Another good way is to take some library like Lodash and implement its methods on arrays/objects yourself.</p>
                            <p>Beginners, firstly, should try more relevant libraries, for example, React Hook Form, on their pet projects. Secondly, deal with testing, performance evaluation, application availability.</p>
                            <p>An excellent indicator if the candidate has grown in position at his place of work. For example, he became a senior from a middle, and a tech lead/team lead from a senior. This is a great characteristic of you as a professional.</p>
                            <p><b>Soft skills</b> are something that is more difficult to evaluate at an interview and that comes to the fore in the demand for a specialist who is already working in a company. Often it is on the basis of soft skills that a decision is made to promote a developer.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">What soft skills are in demand now:</p>
                            <p><b>Quick learner and flexibility</b>, willingness to try and understand new technologies, and not sit on your usual stack, imposing it on colleagues. This is especially true now, in a period of economic instability, when companies need to quickly turn around and need a flexible staff ready to adapt to changes with lightning speed.</p>
                            <p>Immersion in the company's product, namely: the proposal of solutions that are suitable for performing business tasks. For example, when choosing a new technology for a project, you need to look at how it suits a particular business. You do not need to choose the one that you have long wanted to try or you know well.</p>
                            <p><b>Communications.</b> The ability to build relationships with colleagues, share experience, best practices (for example, conduct a workshop for colleagues), correctly present your ideas, and give useful feedback. Many companies may even ask colleagues/company as a whole for an example of a recently given feedback during the interview stage.</p>
                            <p><b>Developer predictability.</b> This is the ability to ask for help from colleagues at the right time, when you are stuck with some task and you feel that you are starting to slow down the process, and the ability to manage working time and independently monitor the deadlines of your tasks.</p>
                            <p><b>Proactivity.</b> The developer is expected to actively participate in all stages of product development at meetings with colleagues, especially when it comes to discussing processes in the team or new features for implementation. Often, simply doing “as it was written in the task” is not enough. You need to have a good idea of ​​what other parts of the product it may affect, offer some solutions or ideas on this matter, warn about possible errors in other parts of the application, offer more sensible solutions in terms of UI / UX.</p>

                            <p class="text-article__bold"> How can a career as a programmer develop?</p>
                            <p>In the field of IT, the career of a programmer develops gradually. It is impossible to jump several steps of the career ladder at once. At the same time, everyone moves at their own pace: someone achieves a promotion in a year, someone will need more time. But professional development can be expressed not only in a higher status position, but also in new knowledge and skills. Depending on this, career growth is called vertical or horizontal.</p>
                            <p>When we talk about the career ladder, we mean vertical growth. A promotion is usually accompanied by an increase in salary, but at the same time, a specialist has new responsibilities and expands the area of responsibility.</p>
                            <p>The transition time to each position, from junior to senior, depends not only on the developer himself, but also on the company in which he works. For example, a programmer can work for 5 years in a small company and become a senior developer. When moving to another organization, he will apply for the same position, but at the interview it may turn out that his knowledge is not enough for a new employer. Another scenario is also possible, when a programmer gets stuck in the middle status for a long time: he performs the same tasks and does not independently make important decisions on the project.
                                This can happen not only to those who do not strive to improve their professional skills, but also to programmers who have little opportunity for growth within their company.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">Growth from junior to middle</p>
                            <p>Every programmer starts his career as a junior. This is the starting point of your route, from which professional experience will be counted. When a junior joins a company, a mentor is often assigned to him. He supervises the newcomer, can check his work. As a rule, after 1-2 years, a junior raises his level to a middle developer.</p>
                            <p>Unlike a junior, a middle programmer is an independent specialist in the development team who does not need to be supervised by more experienced colleagues. The middle developer understands which frameworks and libraries are best suited for each task. On the project, he can already be responsible for individual modules and functions of the application. Having reached the middle level, the programmer is focused not only on his code, but also begins to be interested in the architecture of solutions.</p>
                            <p>In order for a junior programmer to quickly grow to middle, it is worth looking for a job where the process of training personnel and exchanging experience is established. It is better to choose a company with a lower salary, but where employees have working time for training, learning new technologies. At this stage of a career, it is important not only to actively study, but also to consolidate knowledge in practice. You can learn a lot of technologies in theory, but it will be useless if you do not try them out on real problems.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">Growth from middle to senior</p>
                            <p>Senior programmer is the main specialist in the development team. As a rule, in addition to his technology stack, he is interested in software architecture, designs individual parts of the system. A senior developer is no longer just a performer, but rather a co-author of technical ideas. With experience, he has accumulated enough knowledge to assess risks and prevent errors in development.</p>
                            <p>Typically, positions for senior programmers suggest from 3 to 7 years of experience, but the transition to this level can take longer. It all depends on how rich and complex the work of the programmer was during this time.</p>
                            <p>In order for a middle developer to become a senior, it is important to learn to think not in terms of your own code, but at the level of the entire technological solution. It is important to constantly master the latest technologies and tools, such as microservices and containers, and try to make your tasks on the project more complicated. If you find yourself doing only routine work, ask management to let you change projects or work with another team for a few hours a day. To check which tasks are entrusted to senior programmers, you can register on a freelance exchange (for example, Upwork)</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">Where to go next as a senior programmer</p>
                            <p>Senior developers are valued in the labor market, and companies are ready to pay no less for their knowledge than managers. According to the dev.by portal, a senior programmer and a project manager have the same average salary of $5,000. Thus, when moving to other positions, the incentive should not be so much an increase in income as the realization of an interest, either in designing programs or in managing a team.</p>
                            <p>The pinnacle of technological growth for programmers is considered the role of software architect (Software Architect). He designs software solutions, largely defining the tasks of other developers in the team. The architect thinks through scenarios for the interaction of system components and selects technologies for each module</p>
                            <p>Usually developers who have worked for several years in a senior position become architects, because on the way to this position you need to accumulate rich experience and a broad technical outlook. To understand if this direction suits you, you can choose the appropriate online courses.</p>
                            <p>The position of a lead developer (Team Lead) can be a transitional stage from programming to management, as it already includes managing a team. Team Lead organizes the work process during the project, delegates tasks to other developers. He can also conduct interviews with new specialists, be responsible for their adaptation and training. In this position, you need to evaluate the work of colleagues, disassemble someone else's code. This role is suitable for those who are ready to take responsibility for the team. In some companies, Team Lead can also perform the duties of a project manager, that is, actively interact with the customer.</p>
                            <p>The Project Manager role will be a new professional experience for the developer. However, such a transition will not be comfortable for every programmer - instead of hours alone with a computer and code, most of the working time will have to be spent in communication with colleagues and clients. In order for a senior programmer to grow into a successful manager, you need to develop competencies according to the T model (T-shaped skills), that is, supplement your specialization with skills from other areas (team management, task delegation, risk management, knowledge of various industries).</p>
                            <p>If you want to not only manage the project, but also solve technical problems, then the role of Delivery Manager will suit you more than the job of a project manager. This is a new role in IT, and so far such a vacancy can only be found in large companies where dozens of people are involved in the project. The Delivery Manager is responsible for all aspects of the project, including application architecture and other technical issues.</p>
                            <p class="text-article__bold">Where does the career ladder lead?</p>
                            <p>In addition to the salary, the work should bring dividends in the form of advanced training and professional skills. When choosing a company, pay attention to what opportunities for growth they offer. More promising will be a company where a programmer's career does not end with senior status, and you can try yourself in other roles.</p>
